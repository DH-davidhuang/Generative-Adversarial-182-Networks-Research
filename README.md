## Background

GANs have been a breakthrough in image generation, particularly in creating hyper-realistic human faces. This project draws inspiration from advancements like NVIDIA's StyleGAN and extends the application of GANs to anime-style image generation. The aim is to adapt GAN architectures to capture the unique artistic styles of anime and cartoons.

## Methodology

### Training Data
We utilize the Anime Face Dataset NTU-MLDS from Kaggle, consisting of 36,740 anime face images.

### Preprocessing
Images are cropped and resized to 64x64 pixels and normalized to enhance training efficiency.

### Architecture
Our GAN model comprises a generator and a discriminator, each built with convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions.

### Test Data
The model's performance is evaluated using the CAT dataset from Kaggle.

## Installation
